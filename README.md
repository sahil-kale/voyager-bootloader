The Voyager Bootloader is a library intended to enable ‘over-the-air’ device firmware upgrade and boot flash integrity verification capability in bare-metal embedded systems. It is designed to be agnostic of all microcontroller architectures and functionality with no external dependencies and compilable with any C project and system featuring a generic communication transport layer.
